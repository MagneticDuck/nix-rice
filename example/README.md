This is the nixos configuration for my T450s thinkpad laptop. Notice how relevance to software, hardware, and misc configurations that other people will probably not find generally userful partition rice.nix from the rest of my configuration; rice.nix can be exported to another computer with different hardware and user interests, but it will generate the same result in terms of ricing.
