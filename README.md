# nix-rice

## What's Ricing?

Ricing, in a restricted sense, is often used to describe the act of superficially modifying a UI to give it a better design, more suited to personal preference. r/unixporn is an example of a desktop ricing community. 


## What is this Project?

The purpose of the nix-rice project is to use nix to develop and deploy linux desktop ricing configurations, and solve related issues and add necessary features to the nixos system in the process.
